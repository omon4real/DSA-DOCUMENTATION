## Project Topic: Leadership Qualities Of A Pastor & It Relevance In Pastoral Ministry Today

### Project Overview
Leadership is a critical element in the success and sustainability of any ministry. In the context of the Christian faith, pastoral leadership plays a pivotal role in guiding the spiritual growth of individuals and communities. A pastor is not merely a preacher or teacher but also a shepherd, mentor, and visionary leader. The effectiveness of a pastor in fulfilling these roles depends significantly on the leadership qualities he or she embodies.
